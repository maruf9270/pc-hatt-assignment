The heat spreader is built with a lighter, thinner, and high-quality metal material. The colorful light changes make the hollow on the front even more stereoscopic and echo the ultra-wide angle luminous area. The extraordinary Revolution will provide players with a new experience never seen before. DELTA RGB is using full color, dazzling RGB LED lighting with a force flow effect. Like a Jedi holding a lightsaber, players can be invincible in the gaming world. T-FORCE LOGO is like a warriorâ€™s badge, standing still in the changing lights. The full frame, 120Â° ultra wide angle luminous area at the top emits colorful bright light. The color of the light changes smoothly to provide players with an unparalleled visual feast, no matter whether it is day or night. The one-piece, geometric line design makes the heat spreader looks simple but energetic, and the Cubist style in the new art movement is also presented, which is a perfect combination of technology and aesthetics. The embossed lines on the surface not only increase the heat dissipation area and also effectively enhance the cooling of the memory module, so the quality of the operation can be finely stabilized.
