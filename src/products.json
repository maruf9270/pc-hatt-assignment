The heat spreader is built with a lighter, thinner, and high-quality metal material. The colorful light changes make the hollow on the front even more stereoscopic and echo the ultra-wide angle luminous area. The extraordinary Revolution will provide players with a new experience never seen before. DELTA RGB is using full color, dazzling RGB LED lighting with a force flow effect. Like a Jedi holding a lightsaber, players can be invincible in the gaming world. T-FORCE LOGO is like a warriorâ€™s badge, standing still in the changing lights. The full frame, 120Â° ultra wide angle luminous area at the top emits colorful bright light. The color of the light changes smoothly to provide players with an unparalleled visual feast, no matter whether it is day or night. The one-piece, geometric line design makes the heat spreader looks simple but energetic, and the Cubist style in the new art movement is also presented, which is a perfect combination of technology and aesthetics. The embossed lines on the surface not only increase the heat dissipation area and also effectively enhance the cooling of the memory module, so the quality of the operation can be finely stabilized.

It comes with 2nd Generation RT Cores: Experience 2X the throughput of 1st gen RT Cores, plus concurrent RT and shading for a whole new level of ray tracing performance. It also has 3rd Generation Tensor Cores: Get up to 2X the throughput with structural sparsity and advanced AI algorithms such as DLSS. Now with support for up to 8K resolution, these cores deliver a massive boost in-game performance and all-new AI capabilities. A new all-metal shroud houses three powerful axial-tech fans that utilize durable dual ball fan bearings. Fan rotation has been optimized for reduced turbulence, and a stop mode brings all three fans to a halt at low temps. Beneath, independent heatsinks for the GPU and memory keep thermals under tight control. Additional features, including TUF components, Auto-Extreme Technology, a new GPU bracket, and a backplate vent make the TUF a proper powerhouse. Axial-tech fan design, with three fans working in tandem to satisfy the thermal demands of NVIDIA's new high-octane design. The fans rely on dual ball fan bearings to ensure consistent performance and increased longevity compared to sleeve bearings and other bearing types. Dual Ball Fan Bearings can last up to twice as long as a sleeve bearing designs. The two fans spin counterclockwise to reduce turbulence. and to eliminate unnecessary noise, a stop mode halts all fans when the GPU temp falls below 50 degrees and power consumption is low. The heat spreader draws heat up into heat pipes that carry it through a fin stack that fills most of the card's large, 2.7-slot footprint. Military-grade Capacitors and other TUF components enhance durability and performance. An all-aluminium shroud adds robust protection to TUF Gaming graphics cards and a no-nonsense industrial design and grayscale colourway fits into any build with ease. The top-side RGB element can be customized to display a range of aesthetic and functional effects and also synced with other ASUS components to enable uniform lighting.
